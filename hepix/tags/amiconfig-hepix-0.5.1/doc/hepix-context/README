Contextualization disk contents:
--------------------------------
The contextualization disk should contain a 

prolog.sh
epilog.sh 

and any other site specific scripts or files. prolog.sh and epilog.sh are called during
the boot and shutdown sequence, and are under full control of the site. Templates can
be found in 
/usr/share/doc/hepix-context/prolog.sh
/usr/share/doc/hepix-context/epilog.sh

Restrictions:
-------------
In the case of OpenNebula, the site prolog.sh has to source context.sh first which is put automatically 
on the CD image by ONE.
